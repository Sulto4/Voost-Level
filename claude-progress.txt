### Deployment Issue
The Netlify MCP deploy tool keeps timing out with "Connection closed" errors.

**Manual Deployment Required:**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/projects/voost-level-crm
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
3. Connect to GitHub repo: Sulto4/Voost-Level
4. Trigger deploy

OR use Netlify CLI:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --site=2074cc57-c138-4911-bfb6-1b268e6dee0d
```

## Files Modified This Session
- `frontend/.env.example` (NEW - environment variable template)
- `frontend/package.json` (updated build command)
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` (relaxed for production build)
